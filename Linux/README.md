### What a purpose of Kernel?
  * Processes The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU.
  * Memory The kernel needs to keep track of all memory—what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes, and what is free.
  * Device drivers The kernel acts as an interface between hardware (such as a disk) and processes. It’s usually the kernel’s job to operate the hardware.
  * System calls and support Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel.

### What is a user space?
In a computer operating system, **user space** is the portion of memory containing unprivileged processes run by a user. It is strictly separated from kernel space, the portion of memory where privileged operating system kernel processes are executed.
